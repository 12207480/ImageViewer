    case DisplacementKeepOriginalInPlace(Bool) ///Setting this to true is useful when your overlay layer is not fully opaque and you have multiple images on screen at once. The problem is image 1 is going to be displaced (gallery is being presented) and you can see that it is missing in the parent canvas because the canvas bleeds through overlay layer. However when you page to a different image and you decide to dismiss the gallery, that different image is going to be returned (using reveserse displacement). Thats look a bit strange because it is reverse displacing but it actually is already present in the parent canvas whreas the originla image 1 is still missing there. This setting helps you avoid it.

    case OverlayColorOpacity(CGFloat) ///The opacity of overlay layer when the displacement effect finishes anf the gallery is fully presented. Valid values are from 0 to 1 where 1 is full opacity i.e the overlay layer is fully opaque, 0 is completely transparent and effectively invisible.
    case OverlayAccelerationFactor(CGFloat) ///This accelerates or decelerates the pace of overlay opacity transition with relation to the image displacement transition. When we use the bounce effect while  displacing the image, it means the image will reach its destination and will bump there for a while. It took 80 percent of duration time for the image to get there and 20 percent of duration time to bounce there. But we want the overlay opacity to fully reach its target value walready when the image reaches its destination in T = 0.8 duration. The time when it bounces should not be taken into account for the opacity duration. The aceleration factor allows us to twek the opacity transition duration against the displacement duration. So for the example mentioned her we would use 0.8. The value we choose of course depends on the bounce settings so thre is no clear math available for us, it depends a lot on experimentation to get the desired behaviour.
    
    case SwipeToDismissThresholdVelocity(CGFloat) ///the minimum velocity needed for the image to continue on its swipe-to-dismiss path instead of returning to its original position. The velocity is in scalar units per second, which in our case represents points on screen per second. When the thumb moves on screen and eventually is lifted, it traveled along a path and the speed represents the number of points it traveled in the last 1000 msec before it was lifted.
