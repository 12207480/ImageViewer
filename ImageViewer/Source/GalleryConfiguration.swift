However when you page to a different image and you decide to dismiss the gallery, that different image is going to be returned (using reveserse displacement). Thats look a bit strange because it is reverse displacing but it actually is already present in the parent canvas whereas the original image 1 is still missing there. Thre is no meaningful way to manage these deisplaced views. This setting helps to avoid it his problem by keeping the originals in place while still using the displacement effect.
